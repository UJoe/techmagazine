# techmagazine
It was our last team project at our programing school. The aim was to create a sort of magazine in React, which displays real news items and has a Loading Page wchich appears only on your first visit. It was not required in this exercise that the user should be able to select topics and languages, but our team always exceeded the compulsory requirements when we thought some additional features are necessary to make our app or site more realistic and to provide better user experience.

However, it was included in the instructions that we must try to keep the user on our site as long as possible. As it was the last project, we - more precisely: I - interpreted this instruction in a funny way. Users will normally leave this site if they want to read a complete article on its source. Sooo.... try to click on 'continue reading' at the end of the articles... :)

Or does this feature make you angry and you wanna close the window and leave the site anyway? Well, to a certain extent, I can understand you. All I ask you is move towards the closing button slowly... a bit more slowly... almost there... now, a bit to the right... That's it! Click on the Easter Egg you've found and see what happens!

Did you like it or did it frighten you? It's just formatted your winchester, but you wanted to change for a new model, anyway. Or was it not you? Oh, don't worry, there's nothing wrong. :) I hope by now you've forgotten your intention to leave this site and read your article in full. If not...
